Pull request
------------

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Grab** an issue, by requesting to be assigned to it.
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** to `NHLGames\master` so that we can review your changes

> Work on open issues only. If you create a new issue, discuss about it, before starting to work on it

> If you create a new feature or update one, don't forget to add a section about it in the documentation.

> Avoid any merge conflicts by merging the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

Documentation
-------------

Submit a pull request if the documentation is incomplete, has mistakes or is outdated.

Translate
---------

Help us to translate the app by translating the file using Visual Studio, located in:   
`NHLGames\NHLGames\English.resx`    
Do not translate the lines that have `Console` in the Comment column, you can actually remove those.
